# The Book of Job

* A couple questions before we start:
   * What are a couple of things that you know about the book of Job?
   * Have you ever accused God of being unjust?
   
Let's now watch a couple of videos from [The Bible Project](https://thebibleproject.com).

## Initial thoughts?

* What did you learn about Job that you did not know before?


## Scripture
* Psalm 89:5-8

<p>5 Let the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord,
    your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!
6 For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?
    Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord,
7 a God greatly to be feared in **the council** of the holy ones,
    and awesome above all who are around him?
8 O Lord God of hosts,
    who is mighty as you are, O Lord,
    with your faithfulness all around you?</p>

* **This is a reference to the Divine Council. This is where God assembles his staff to go over what is happening everywhere and assigns duties. See also [Psalm 103:20-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A20-21&version=NET), human version of this in [1 Kings 22:13-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+22%3A13-23&version=NET), and even in [Isaiah 6:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+6%3A1-8&version=NET). Keep this in mind when reading the beginning of the book of Job.**


* Chapter 1:6-12

Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord—and *The Accuser* also arrived among them. The Lord said to *The Accuser*, “Where have you come from?” And *The Accuser* answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”  So the Lord said to *The Accuser*, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.”

Then *The Accuser* answered the Lord, “Is it for nothing that Job fears God? Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land. But extend your hand and strike everything he has, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”

So the Lord said to *The Accuser*, “All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!” So *The Accuser* went out from the presence of the Lord.

* **Who is The Accuser? What is the role of The Accuser?**



## Five Milestones
1. **God Tests Job**
    * The book of Job questions God's justice.
    Will upright and blameless Job continue to serve God if he loses everything, or will he stay faithful?
2. **Job Accuses God**
    * Job accuses God of acting unjustly while his friends blame him for wrongdoing.
    They all believe God operates the universe according to rules of justice.
3. **Job Questions God**
    * Job reviews his good works and questions why God would allow him to suffer,
    but he sees his pain through the lens of his limited view.
4. **God's Virtual Tour**
    * God responds to Job personally with a virtual tour of the world.
    He reminds Job that His worldview is infinite while Job's view is limited. 
5. **Job Learns Trust**
    * God doesn't explain our suffering, but He reminds Job
    that we live in a complex world and asks us to trust His character and wisdom.
