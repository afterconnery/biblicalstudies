# The Book of Job

* A couple questions before we start:
   * What are a couple of your favorite one liners from the book?
   * Do you think the wisdom from Proverbs always hold up in real life?
   
Let's now watch a couple of videos from [The Bible Project](https://thebibleproject.com).

## Initial thoughts?

* What did you learn about Job that you did not know before?


## Scripture


## Five Milestones
1. **God Tests Job**
    * The book of Job questions God's justice.
    Will upright and blameless Job continue to serve God if he loses everything, or will he stay faithful?
2. **Job Accuses God**
    * Job accuses God of acting unjustly while his friends blame him for wrongdoing.
    They all believe God operates the universe according to rules of justice.
3. **Job Questions God**
    * Job reviews his good works and questions why God would allow him to suffer,
    but he sees his pain through the lens of his limited view.
4. **God's Virtual Tour**
    * God responds to Job personally with a virtual tour of the world.
    He reminds Job that His worldview is infinite while Job's view is limited. 
5. **Job Learns Trust**
    * God doesn't explain our suffering, but He reminds Job
    that we live in a complex world and asks us to trust His character and wisdom.
