## Initial thoughts?

* What did you learn about Job that you did not know before?


## Scripture
* Psalm 89:5-8

<p>5 Let the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord,
    your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!
6 For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?
    Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord,
7 a God greatly to be feared in **the council** of the holy ones,
    and awesome above all who are around him?
8 O Lord God of hosts,
    who is mighty as you are, O Lord,
    with your faithfulness all around you?</p>

* **This is a reference to the Divine Council. This is where God assembles his staff to go over what is happening everywhere and assigns duties. See also [Psalm 103:20-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A20-21&version=NET), human version of this in [1 Kings 22:13-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+22%3A13-23&version=NET), and even in [Isaiah 6:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+6%3A1-8&version=NET). Keep this in mind when reading the beginning of the book of Job.**


* Chapter 1:6-12

Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord—and *The Accuser* also arrived among them. The Lord said to *The Accuser*, “Where have you come from?” And *The Accuser* answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”  So the Lord said to *The Accuser*, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.”

Then *The Accuser* answered the Lord, “Is it for nothing that Job fears God? Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land. But extend your hand and strike everything he has, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”

So the Lord said to *The Accuser*, “All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!” So *The Accuser* went out from the presence of the Lord.

* **Who is The Accuser? What is the role of The Accuser? How does this image of Satan differ from what you were taught?**

* Chapter 4:7-9 (Eliphaz the Temanite)

7 “Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished?
    Where were the upright ever destroyed?
8 As I have observed, those who plow evil
    and those who sow trouble reap it.
9 At the breath of God they perish;
    at the blast of his anger they are no more.

* Chapter 8:2-7 (Bildad the Shuhite)

2 “How long will you say such things?
    Your words are a blustering wind.
3 Does God pervert justice?
    Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
4 When your children sinned against him,
    he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
5 But if you will seek God earnestly
    and plead with the Almighty,
6 if you are pure and upright,
    even now he will rouse himself on your behalf
    and restore you to your prosperous state.
7 Your beginnings will seem humble,
    so prosperous will your future be.

* Chapter 11:2-12 (Zophar the Naamathite)

2 “Are all these words to go unanswered?
    Is this talker to be vindicated?
3 Will your idle talk reduce others to silence?
    Will no one rebuke you when you mock?
4 You say to God, ‘My beliefs are flawless
    and I am pure in your sight.’
5 Oh, how I wish that God would speak,
    that he would open his lips against you
6 and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom,
    for true wisdom has two sides.
    Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.

7 “Can you fathom the mysteries of God?
    Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
8 They are higher than the heavens above—what can you do?
    They are deeper than the depths below—what can you know?
9 Their measure is longer than the earth
    and wider than the sea.

10 “If he comes along and confines you in prison
    and convenes a court, who can oppose him?
11 Surely he recognizes deceivers;
    and when he sees evil, does he not take note?
12 But the witless can no more become wise
    than a wild donkey’s colt can be born human.

* **How do Job's friends see what has happened to Job? Where does their worldview stem from? Are they right?**

* Chapter 29:2-17

2 “How I long for the months gone by,
    for the days when God watched over me,
3 when his lamp shone on my head
    and by his light I walked through darkness!
4 Oh, for the days when I was in my prime,
    when God’s intimate friendship blessed my house,
5 when the Almighty was still with me
    and my children were around me,
6 when my path was drenched with cream
    and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.

7 “When I went to the gate of the city
    and took my seat in the public square,
8 the young men saw me and stepped aside
    and the old men rose to their feet;
9 the chief men refrained from speaking
    and covered their mouths with their hands;
10 the voices of the nobles were hushed,
    and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
11 Whoever heard me spoke well of me,
    and those who saw me commended me,
12 because I rescued the poor who cried for help,
    and the fatherless who had none to assist them.
13 The one who was dying blessed me;
    I made the widow’s heart sing.
14 I put on righteousness as my clothing;
    justice was my robe and my turban.
15 I was eyes to the blind
    and feet to the lame.
16 I was a father to the needy;
    I took up the case of the stranger.
17 I broke the fangs of the wicked
    and snatched the victims from their teeth.

* Chapter 30:9-15

9  “And now those young men mock me in song;
    I have become a byword among them.
10 They detest me and keep their distance;
    they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
11 Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me,
    they throw off restraint in my presence.
12 On my right the tribe[c] attacks;
    they lay snares for my feet,
    they build their siege ramps against me.
13 They break up my road;
    they succeed in destroying me.
    ‘No one can help him,’ they say.
14 They advance as through a gaping breach;
    amid the ruins they come rolling in.
15 Terrors overwhelm me;
    my dignity is driven away as by the wind,
    my safety vanishes like a cloud.

* Chapter 31:35-37

35 (“Oh, that I had someone to hear me!
    I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me;
    let my accuser put his indictment in writing.
36 Surely I would wear it on my shoulder,
    I would put it on like a crown.
37 I would give him an account of my every step;
    I would present it to him as to a ruler.)—

* **How does Job respond after long discussions with his friends? How does Job view what happened to him?** 

* Chapter 38:1-18

1 Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said:

2 “Who is this that obscures my plans
    with words without knowledge?
3 Brace yourself like a man;
    I will question you,
    and you shall answer me.

4 “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
    Tell me, if you understand.
5 Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!
    Who stretched a measuring line across it?
6 On what were its footings set,
    or who laid its cornerstone—
7 while the morning stars sang together
    and all the angels[a] shouted for joy?

8 “Who shut up the sea behind doors
    when it burst forth from the womb,
9 when I made the clouds its garment
    and wrapped it in thick darkness,
10 when I fixed limits for it
    and set its doors and bars in place,
11 when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther;
    here is where your proud waves halt’?

12 “Have you ever given orders to the morning,
    or shown the dawn its place,
13 that it might take the earth by the edges
    and shake the wicked out of it?
14 The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;
    its features stand out like those of a garment.
15 The wicked are denied their light,
    and their upraised arm is broken.

16 “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea
    or walked in the recesses of the deep?
17 Have the gates of death been shown to you?
    Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?
18 Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth?
    Tell me, if you know all this.

* Chapter 40:8-14

8 “Would you discredit my justice?
    Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
9 Do you have an arm like God’s,
    and can your voice thunder like his?
10 Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor,
    and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.
11 Unleash the fury of your wrath,
    look at all who are proud and bring them low,
12 look at all who are proud and humble them,
    crush the wicked where they stand.
13 Bury them all in the dust together;
    shroud their faces in the grave.
14 Then I myself will admit to you
    that your own right hand can save you.


* **What is God's response to Job's accusation? What do you think of God's response? What does God tell Job about justice?**

* Chapter 42:1-6

1 Then Job replied to the Lord:

2 “I know that you can do all things;
    no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
3 You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’
    Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,
    things too wonderful for me to know.

4 “You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak;
    I will question you,
    and you shall answer me.’
5 My ears had heard of you
    but now my eyes have seen you.
6 Therefore I despise myself
    and repent in dust and ashes.”

* **How does Job respond to God's response? What did Job learn about justice and how it's metered out?**

## Five Milestones
1. **God Tests Job**
    * The book of Job questions God's justice.
    Will upright and blameless Job continue to serve God if he loses everything, or will he stay faithful?
2. **Job Accuses God**
    * Job accuses God of acting unjustly while his friends blame him for wrongdoing.
    They all believe God operates the universe according to rules of justice.
3. **Job Questions God**
    * Job reviews his good works and questions why God would allow him to suffer,
    but he sees his pain through the lens of his limited view.
4. **God's Virtual Tour**
    * God responds to Job personally with a virtual tour of the world.
    He reminds Job that His worldview is infinite while Job's view is limited. 
5. **Job Learns Trust**
    * God doesn't explain our suffering, but He reminds Job
    that we live in a complex world and asks us to trust His character and wisdom.
