# The Book of Ecclesiastes

* A couple questions before we start:
   * Have you read any/all of Ecclestiastes before?
   * What are your expectations about how the world works?
   
Let's now watch a couple of videos from [The Bible Project](https://thebibleproject.com).

## Initial Thoughts
* What surprised you?

* Is this what you expected Ecclestiastes would be about?

* Should this book be included in the biblical canon?

## Scripture
* Chapter 1:17-2:2
  <p>And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind. Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain. I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself.” And behold, it too was futility [Hevel]. I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”</p>
* **This person is supposed to be the greatest and wisest of all rulers over Jerusalem (1:16). What do we learn about life from his perspective? How does this make you feel about your own life and it's prospects?**

* Chapter 8:14-15
  <p>There is futility [Hevel]  which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility [Hevel]. So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry, and this will stand by him in his toils throughout the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.</p>
* **Do we always get what we want/deserve? Is it worth doing the right thing if we don't know what the outcome will be for us?** 
* **Hevel is used here to represent absudrity or paradox. Why does the Teacher commend simple pleasures if life is absurd? Do you think the Teacher thinks there is a purpose to life? Do you?**

* Chapter 2:17-26
  <p> So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility[Hevel] and striving after wind.</p>
  <p>Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me. And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity[Hevel]. Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun. When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity[Hevel] and a great evil. For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun? Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity[Hevel].</p>
  <p> There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God. For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him? For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God’s sight. This too is vanity[Hevel] and striving after wind.</p> 
* **What is the Teacher's view of work? How do you view your own work? What effort should we give to our labors?**
    
* Chapter 12:13-14
  <p>The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person. For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.</p> 
* **What is the Author's conclusion? Does this line up with what we have been hearing from the Teacher?** 

## Five Key Points

1. **Hevel**
    * The author of the Book of Ecclesiastes believes that life is hevel or beautiful and mysterious but unclear, confusing, disorienting and uncontrollable like the fog.
2. **March of Time**
    * Our existence is like a blur or blink of an eye and passes as a shadow compared to the longevity of God's creation and timeline.
3. **We All Die**
    * No matter what we do or who we are, we will die. Death is the great equalizer that renders most of our daily activities meaningless.
4. **Life's Random Nature**
    * Life is unpredictable, out of our control and nonsensical. Good people suffer while evil people live long. We fail if we try to master life.
5. **Fear God**
    * Life is mysterious, but we can fear God, keep His commandments, enjoy the moment and trust His judgment because one day He will clear hevel.
