## Initial thoughts?

* What did you learn about Proverbs that you did not know before?

* The Law and Prophets derive their religious authority from God. Where does the authority come from in Proverbs?

## Scripture

* Proverbs 1:1-6
<p>1. The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
2. To learn wisdom and moral instruction, and to discern wise counsel. 3. To receive moral instruction in skillful living,
in righteousness, justice, and equity. 4. To impart shrewdness to the morally naive, and a discerning plan to the young person. 5. (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, and let the discerning acquire guidance!) 6. To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable, the sayings of the wise and their riddles. </p>

* **Who is the author of this book? Why is this important to point out? How is this different to Ecclesiastes?**

* Proverbs 1:20-33
<p>20 Wisdom calls out in the street,
she shouts loudly in the plazas;
21 
at the head of the noisy streets she calls,
in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:
22 
“How long will you simpletons love naiveté?
How long will mockers delight in mockery
and fools hate knowledge?
23 
If only you will respond to my rebuke,
then I will pour out my thoughts to you
and I will make my words known to you.
24 
However, because I called but you refused to listen,
because I stretched out my hand but no one paid attention,
25 
because you neglected all my advice,
and did not comply with my rebuke,
26 
so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you,
I will mock when what you dread comes,
27 
when what you dread comes like a whirlwind,
and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm,
when distressing trouble comes on you.
28 
Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;
they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.
29 
Because they hated moral knowledge,
and did not choose to fear the Lord,
30 
they did not comply with my advice,
they spurned all my rebuke.
31 
Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way,
and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.
32 
For the waywardness of the
simpletons will kill them,
and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.
33 
But the one who listens to me will live in security,
and will be at ease from the dread of harm.</p>

* **This is the first poem from Lady Wisdom (Sophia). What do we learn about her?**

* Proverbs 10:22-28
<p> 22 
The blessing from the Lord makes a person rich,
and he adds no sorrow to it.
23 
Carrying out a wicked scheme is enjoyable to a fool,
and so is wisdom for the one who has discernment.
24 
What the wicked fears will come on him;
what the righteous desire will be granted.
25 
When the storm passes through, the wicked are swept away,
but the righteous are an everlasting foundation.
26 
Like vinegar to the teeth and like smoke to the eyes,
so is the sluggard to those who send him.
27 
Fearing the Lord prolongs life,
but the life span of the wicked will be shortened.
28 
The hope of the righteous is joy,
but the expectation of the wicked will remain unfulfilled.</p>

* **Is this always true in life? If it isn't, then why is it in here?

* Proverbs 30:1-5
<p> 30 The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle:
This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:
2 
Surely I am more brutish than any other human being,
and I do not have human understanding;
3 
I have not learned wisdom,
nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One.
4 
Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?
Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?
Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?
Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is his name, and what is his son’s name?—if you know!
5 
Every word of God is purified;
he is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.</p>

* **Who is Agur and why does he have his own chapter in Proverbs?

* Proverbs 31:1-9
<p> 1 The words of King Lemuel,
an oracle that his mother taught him:
2 
O my son, O son of my womb,
O son of my vows,
3 
Do not give your strength to women,
nor your ways to that which ruins kings.
4 
It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
it is not for kings to drink wine,
or for rulers to crave strong drink,
5 
lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
and remove from all the poor their legal rights.
6 
Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
and wine to those who are bitterly distressed;
7 
let them drink and forget their poverty,
and remember their misery no more.
8 
Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,
for the legal rights of all the dying.
9 
Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,
and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>

* **Who is the author of this chapter? Whose wisdom is this from and who is it for?**

* Proverbs 31:10-31
<p> 10 
Who can find a wife of noble character?
For her value is far more than rubies.
11 
The heart of her husband has confidence in her,
and he has no lack of gain.
12 
She brings him good and not evil
all the days of her life.
13 
She obtains wool and flax,
and she is pleased to work with her hands.
14 
She is like the merchant ships;
she brings her food from afar.
15 
She also gets up while it is still night,
and provides food for her household and a portion to her female servants.
16 
She considers a field and buys it;
from her own income she plants a vineyard.
17 
She begins her work vigorously,
and she strengthens her arms.
18 
She knows that her merchandise is good,
and her lamp does not go out in the night.
19 
Her hands take hold of the distaff,
and her hands grasp the spindle.
20 
She extends her hand to the poor,
and reaches out her hand to the needy.
21 
She is not afraid of the snow for her household,
for all of her household are clothed with scarlet.
22 
She makes for herself coverlets;
her clothing is fine linen and purple.
23 
Her husband is well-known in the city gate
when he sits with the elders of the land.
24 
She makes linen garments and sells them,
and supplies the merchants with sashes.
25 
She is clothed with strength and honor,
and she can laugh at the time to come.
26 
She opens her mouth with wisdom,
and loving instruction is on her tongue.
27 
She watches over the ways of her household,
and does not eat the bread of idleness.
28 
Her children rise up and call her blessed,
her husband also praises her:
29 
“Many daughters have done valiantly,
but you surpass them all!”
30 
Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting,
but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.
31 
Give her credit for what she has accomplished,
and let her works praise her in the city gates. </p>

* **What do we learn about this woman? Is this a template that all women should follow? Why have this in Proverbs and why at the end of the book?**

## Five Milestones
1. Purpose of Proverbs
  * The book of Proverbs contains sayings and riddles featuring wisdom, applied knowledge that helps every person develop practical skills to live well in God's world.
2. Fear of the Lord
  * The journey to wisdom begins with fear of the Lord, a reverential and healthy respect of Him. Only then can we embrace a moral mindset.
3. Generational Insight
  * Ten speeches from a father and four poems from lady wisdom show us that Proverbs is God's own invitation to learn wisdom from previous generations. 
4. The Good Life
  * Read hundreds of sayings that apply wisdom and fear of the Lord to every subject imaginable. They offer formulas for success but are not promises. 
5. Godly Woman
  * A woman of noble character models someone who takes God's wisdom found in Proverbs and translates it into practical decisions for success in everyday life.
